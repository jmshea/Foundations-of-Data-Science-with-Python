    "### Intro to Markdown in Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "The example notebook `jupyter-intro.ipynb` demonstrates the main features of Markdown that are used in the book. This section provides a more detailed description than could be included in the book itself:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Headings**\n",
    "\n",
    "The first cell (starting with \"Intro to Markdown\") illustrates how to use Markdown to format headings.\n",
    "Headings are entered by prefacing text with one or more # (usually pronounced \"hash\") symbols followed by a space. If you know any HTML, then `# Title` is equivalent to a `<h1>Title</h1>`, `### Subtitle` is equivalent to `<h2>Subtitle</h2>`, etc. Note that you must put a space between the hashes and the text for it to be recognized as a heading.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Text and paragraphs**\n",
    "\n",
    "The second cell shows paragraphs of text. Regular text can be entered as normal. \n",
    "Blank lines between text indicate the start of a new paragraph; press `Enter` twice\n",
    "at the end of a paragraph to leave such a blank line.\n",
    "Other line breaks do not create a new paragraph and can be used\n",
    "to avoid over-long lines of text or to separate sentences so they can be \n",
    "more easily reordered in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Emphasis**\n",
    "\n",
    "The third cell (labeled \"***Emphasis***\") illustrates how to make text italicized or bold.  Double click on the cell (to view the source text).  \n",
    "* Text can be italicized by surrounding it with single asterisks, like `*italicize text*`: *italicize text*.\n",
    "* Similarly, text can be bolded by surrounding it with double asterisks, like `**bold text**`: **bold text**.\n",
    "* Text can be both italicized and bolded by surrounding it with triple asterisks, like `***bold and italics***`: ***bold and italics***.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Bulleted and Numbered Lists**\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth cell illustrates how to make bulleted and numbered lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bulleted lists** can be created by starting a line with an asterisk and a space, followed by the text of the bulleted item. Bulleted sub-lists can be created by tab-indenting a bulleted list under a bulleted item. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "* Item 1\n",
    "    * Item 1.1\n",

    "    * Item 1.2\n",
    "*Item 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numbered lists** can be created by starting a line with a number, a period, and a space, followed by the item to be numbered. *Note that the first number you use in a sequence of numbered items will determine the starting point for numbering, but later values are ignored. It is a good habit to use 1 for every numbered item because then you can rearrange the items via cut-and-paste without worrying about upsetting the overall list numbering.*  Numbered sub-lists can be created by tab-indenting a numbered list under a numbered item. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "1. Item 1\n",
    "    1. Item 1.1\n",

    "3. Item 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Links and images**\n",
    "\n",
    "The fifth cell gives an example of a link and an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Links** are easily created by putting the link text in square brackets, followed by the link URL in parentheses, like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Example link](http://google.com)\n",
    "```\n",
    "which is rendered as \n",
    "\n",
    "[Example link](http://google.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Images** are entered in a very similar way to URLs. Just put an exclamation point (!) before the square brackets. The text in the square brackets will be used as the \"alt text\", which is used by screen readers or displayed when hovering the mouse over the image. Images can also be inserted by dragging them from your file manager into a cell. After the Markdown code is inserted, you can edit the alt-text to something more meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Mathematics**\n",
    "\n",
    "```{index} Jupyter; LaTeX\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The sixth cell (labeled \"Mathematics\") illustrates formatted mathematics.   Markdown in Jupyter supports sophisticated formatting of mathematics using\n",

    "<!-- $\\LaTeX$ -->\n",
    "LaTeX notation between dollar signs, like `$\\sin^2 x$` renders as $\\sin^2 x$. \n",
    "Longer equations should be displayed on lines separate from the text and can be created by enclosing them between pairs of dollar signs. For example,\n",
