    "**Simulating Conditional Probabilities**\n",
    "* Consider designing a simulation to estimate some conditional probability $P(A|B)$. The usual approach is to use two counters. One counts the number of times the conditioning event occurs, so $N_B$ counts the number of occurrences of event $B$. A second counter, $N_{AB}$ counts the number of times $A$ occurs when $B$ has occurred. The first counter is updated within an `if` statement that checks that $B$ has occurred. Within that `if` statement, a nested `if` statement checks whether $A$ has occurred and increments the counter $N_{AB}$ if it has.\n",
    "* When simulating conditional probabilities, the number of simulation iterations cannot be determined from $P(A|B)$ but instead must be determined from $P(A \\cap B)$. An alternative is to simulate until each counter detects a sufficient number of events (typically $>100$)."

For instance, in the Magician's Coin problem, many people initially think that getting heads on the second flip of the coin is independent of the event that the magician got heads on the first flip of the coin. One way to avoid this intuition failure is to imagine a much more extreme scenario. For this example, instead of thinking about getting heads on just one flip of the coin, imagine that the first one million flips were heads. Then the chosen coin must almost surely be the two-headed coin, and the probability of getting heads on the next flip should be very close to 1. "
