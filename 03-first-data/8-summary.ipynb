    "* *Outliers* are values in a data set that are not reasonable.\n",
    "* Outliers may be due to measurement errors, unit-conversion errors, or data-entry errors.\n",
    "* Scatter plots are useful for initial data exploration and identifying outliers.\n",
    "* When plotting two variables that represent different types of data on the same axis, it can be helpful to create a second $y$-axis to deal with differences in the scales for the two variables. \n",
    "* Before plots are communicated to others, they should be properly labeled, including $x$- and $y$-axis labels, a title (or caption), and a legend (if needed)."

    "* A *statistical hypothesis* is a hypothesis that is testable using data.\n",

    "* A *null hypothesis* for multiple groups is that there is no underlying differences among the groups (in the statistic being measured).\n",
    "* An *alternative hypothesis* is that the observed differences or effects represent real differences among the groups or data.\n",
    "* The null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis are usually denoted by $H_0$ and $H_a$, respectively.\n",
    "* A *binary hypothesis test* is a statistical test that decides between two competing statistical hypotheses.\n",
    "* A *null hypothesis significance test (NHST)* estimates the probability that the observed effect could have occurred under a null hypothesis.\n",
    "* In a NHST:\n",
    "    * A statistical test is used to determine how often we would see such a large value of the test statistic under the null hypothesis. The probability of seeing such a large value under $H_0$ is called the $p$-value\n",
    "        * Test statistics may be used in one-sided or two-sided tests. This will be discussed more in {doc}`Section 5.3<../05-null-hypothesis-testing/calculating-p-values>` \n",
    "    * The typical threshold for determining statistical significance is $p < 0.05$\n",
    "    * If $p<0.05$, we say that we *reject the null hypothesis*. We cannot say that the alternative hypothesis is true.\n",
    "    * If $p \\ge 0.05$, we say that we *fail to reject the null hypothesis*. We cannot say that the null hypothesis is false. Often we may fail to reject the null hypothesis because we do not have enough data.\n",
    " * Statistical tests can be characterized as model-based or model-free.\n",
    "* In *model-based* techniques, the data is assumed to come from a known statistical distribution. Such techniques allow the use of analytical methods.\n",
    "* In *model-free* techniques, no assumption is made about the data fitting to some statistical model. Analytical methods are not possible.\n",
    "* *Resampling* is a model-free technique that draws new samples from the data for use in statistical testing.\n",
    "* When resampling is used with a NHST for data from two groups, the data is *pooled* (collected into one group) before resampling.\n",
    "* *Bootstrap resampling* is when data is drawn from the pooled data with replacement.\n",
    "* When performing bootstrap resampling to get samples to represent multiple groups, the sizes of the samples must match the sizes of the groups in the original data set.\n",
    "* To conduct a NHST with resampling:\n",
    "    * Each simulation iteration draws new groups of sample data from the pooled data.\n",
    "    * The sample test statistic is computed.\n",
    "    * The sample test statistic is compared to the observed value of that test statistic, and a counter is incremented if the sample value is at least as large as the observed value.\n",
    "    * After all the iterations, the relative frequency of seeing a test-statistic value at least as extreme as that observed in the data, under $H_0$, is computed. That is the $p$-value, and it is compared to the predetermined $p$-value threshold.\n",
